    <h2>Who We Are?</h2>
    <p> The metaverse is the next evolution of social connection. Our company’s vision is to help bring the metaverse to life, so we are changing our name to reflect our commitment to this future.
     We’re already developing exciting new technologies that will help people connect and explore in the metaverse.

     The metaverse will be a collective project that goes beyond a single company. It will be created by people all over the world, and open to everyone.

     The metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the Internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets.

     Metaverses, in some limited form, have already been implemented in video games such as Second Life.
     Some iterations of the metaverse involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies.
     
     Current metaverse development is centered on addressing the technological limitations with virtual and augmented reality devices.
     
     The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." It has since gained notoriety as a buzzword for promotion, and as a way to generate hype for public relations purposes by making vague claims for future projects.
     Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>
