                <h2>Meta</h2>
                <p>Meta Platforms, doing business as Meta and formerly known as Facebook, is a multinational technology conglomerate based in Menlo Park, California. 
                    The company is the parent organization of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among other subsidiaries. 
                    Meta is one of the world's most valuable companies and is considered one of the Big Tech companies in U.S. information technology, alongside Amazon, Google, Apple, and Microsoft.
                    The company generates a substantial share of its revenue from the sale of advertisement placements to marketers.

                <h2>Metaverse</h2>
            
                <p> The metaverse is a hypothesized iteration of the Internet, supporting persistent online 3-D virtual environments through conventional personal computing, as well as virtual and augmented reality headsets.

                    Metaverses, in some limited form, have already been implemented in video games such as Second Life.
                    Some iterations of the metaverse involve integration between virtual and physical spaces and virtual economies.
                    
                    Current metaverse development is centered on addressing the technological limitations with virtual and augmented reality devices.
                    
                    The term "metaverse" has its origins in the 1992 science fiction novel Snow Crash as a portmanteau of "meta" and "universe." It has since gained notoriety as a buzzword for promotion, and as a way to generate hype for public relations purposes by making vague claims for future projects.
                    Information privacy and user addiction are concerns within the metaverse, stemming from challenges facing the social media and video game industries as a whole.</p>
